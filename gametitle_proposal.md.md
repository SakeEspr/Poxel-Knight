**🕹️ Level 1: Title & Hook**

Poxel Knight  
I chose this because my game is a reskin of another game named hollow knight and its a lot more pixelated, so Pixel \+ Hollow makes Poxel Knight in my eyes.

**🕹️ Level 2: Choose Your Genre**

**🎮 Core Genre:**

Action

My game fits this genre because it is a fighting game in which you explore and have to fight different enemies and hopefully bosses.

**📜 Scrolling / Perspective:**

Multi-directional

Multi-directional as you are able to jump, dash, go side to side, and the camera follows you as you move around.

**🧗 Movement & Abilities:**

Jumping | Double-jumping | Wall-jumping | Climbing | Falling/descending | Dashing

Within the game you can do all of these actions, as you are meant to traverse different areas along with use movement to avoid bosses.

**⚔️ Action / Conflict:**

Combat | Melee attacks | Boss fights | Hazards

Within the game you will fight several bosses, fight small enemies, and avoid hazards throughout the world with movement.

**🏗 Structure / Progression:**

Branching paths | Boss towers 

The game will have a constant branching map, that will just be constantly added onto and will have bosses in some areas that you can explore.

**🎨 Aesthetic / Tone:**

Retro / Pixel art | Fantasy 

The game is going to be made of pixel art, and with a retro vibe or 8 bit kind of look. The game will be set in a kind of underground, castle, fantasy world.

**🧩 Challenge Style:**

Precision platforming | Speed / reflexes | Exploration

The game will have you maneuver throughout a world in which you have to avoid obstacles, enemies, world hazards, along with avoiding bosses and enemies with speed and reflexes.

**🕹️ Level 3: Backstory**

* This place is an empty corrupted world in which you, the knight, have to get rid of the corruption and find out what is happening within the world. As you venture through you meet both friendly faces and foes, those who are your friends will help you traverse and explore the world, while your foes will attempt to kill you. Many of these foes are either fellow knights, or corrupted creatures which have been turned and only seek to destroy what is in their way. As you explore the world you find the origin of the corruption and seek to contain and cure the residents of your world. The game will most likely be set in an underground, dark world filled with vast terrain and underground cities that once thrived.  
    
* The protagonist has no memory of who they are, they aren’t necessarily anybody in particular. They are a hollow vessel which has been drawn to this corrupted and distraught world. They seem to be on a mission to contain and destroy whatever is present, and seem to have no other purpose. They don’t speak, they don’t have their own thoughts. They simply watch and observe as they meet friends, foes, and many more. They simply exist, journeying throughout the broken underground.

**🕹️ Level 4: Characters**

The protagonist is a small knight, with a white mask, and dull robes and capes. They don’t have any motivations but are unknowingly drawn to the underground world within the game.

The antagonists within the game are the corruption and many of the random bosses present throughout the world that seek to end the knights quest.

Other key characters include random guides that will show you how to play the game, direct you to new areas, give you lore or background information, and give you tips.

**🕹️ Level 5: Target Market / Audience**

People would play my game because of the pixelated artstyle and an interesting theme. They would enjoy it because of its difficulty and because you would want to keep advancing to find out what’s next in the game

**🕹️ Level 6: Player Motivations**

Exploring new areas, progressing through the story, and defeating new bosses keeps the player motivated to keep going, as the further you go, the more you get to unlock.

**🕹️ Level 7: Unique Selling Point (USP)**

What makes your game stand out?  
(Think: special mechanics, story depth, art style, customization, mythology, progression system.)

What makes the game stand out is the 8-bit artstyle along with having a lot of movement based mechanics.

**🕹️ Level 8: Inspirations & Competition**

Hollow Knight is the main basis of the game, the mechanics, structure of the lore, world maps, etc. I would do it differently by making more of a retro version in which you have to fight computer corruption in an 8-bit world as opposed to a disease spreading throughout the enemies.

Dead cells, another game similar to hollow knight, where you as the character fight your way out a diseased world, where you tend to die a lot. The aspect of constant death and learning will be a major part of the game, though I will make it different as within Dead Cells you restart every time you die, whereas in my game you would keep the majority of your stuff.

Hollow Knight. My game would be unique from this because it utilizes a completely different cast of characters, enemies, a reskin on the initial story of corruption, to be a more modern digitalized corruption.

**🕹️ Level 9: Goals**

I hope players feel excited and frustrated while playing my game. The idea of constantly dying and growing within the game will allow players to sort of suffer and struggle when initially fighting or learning, though will give them a sense of accomplishment when they do finally win.
